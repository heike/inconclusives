Here, we report on the results of the ongoing “10-barrel test” up until the point in time of writing this manuscript. To analyze the totality of data thus far collected, a Bayesian approach was selected. Posterior average examiner error rates are assigned assuming only vague prior information. Given the data found over the course of this diverse decades-long study, our most conservative value for average examiner error rate has a posterior mean of 0.053\% with a 95\% probability interval of [1.1 × 10−5\%, 0.16\%].},

It suggests that the NRC's proposals for federal regulation of the forensic sciences are more appropriate for a unitary state than a federal system. The NRC report could have been strengthened by examining the British experience with a forensic regulator and a 2008 report on forensic pathology in the Canadian province of Ontario. The Ontario pathology report has already produced tangible reforms to the practice of forensic pathology within coroners' systems while the NRC unrealistically calls for the abolition of all coroner systems. The dangers of superficial reforms are examined, including a Canadian example of published research being misapplied in a manner that contributed to a wrongful conviction. Finally, the NRC's pessimistic conclusions about judicial exclusion of unreliable forensic science are contrasted with recent and more optimistic reform proposals in Canada and the United Kingdom.},

    abstract = {The ensemble method random forests has become a popular classification tool in bioinformatics and related fields. The out-of-bag error is an error estimation technique often used to evaluate the accuracy of a random forest and to select appropriate values for tuning parameters, such as the number of candidate predictors that are randomly drawn for a split, referred to as mtry. However, for binary classification problems with metric predictors it has been shown that the out-of-bag error can overestimate the true prediction error depending on the choices of random forests parameters. Based on simulated and real data this paper aims to identify settings for which this overestimation is likely. It is, moreover, questionable whether the out-of-bag error can be used in classification tasks for selecting tuning parameters like mtry, because the overestimation is seen to depend on the parameter mtry. The simulation-based and real-data based studies with metric predictor variables performed in this paper show that the overestimation is largest in balanced settings and in settings with few observations, a large number of predictor variables, small correlations between predictors and weak effects. There was hardly any impact of the overestimation on tuning parameter selection. However, although the prediction performance of random forests was not substantially affected when using the out-of-bag error for tuning parameter selection in the present studies, one cannot be sure that this applies to all future data. For settings with metric predictor variables it is therefore strongly recommended to use stratified subsampling with sampling fractions that are proportional to the class sizes for both tuning parameter selection and error estimation in random forests. This yielded less biased estimates of the true prediction error. In unbalanced settings, in which there is a strong interest in predicting observations from the smaller classes well, sampling the same number of observations from each class is a promising alternative.},

	abstract = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148???156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

  abstract = {The field of firearms and toolmark analysis has encountered deep scrutiny of late, stemming from a handful of voices, primarily in the law and statistical communities. While strong scrutiny is a healthy and necessary part of any scientific endeavor, much of the current criticism leveled at firearm and toolmark analysis is, at best, misinformed and, at worst, punditry. One of the most persistent criticisms stems from the view that as the field lacks quantified random match probability data (or at least a firm statistical model) with which to calculate the probability of a false match, all expert testimony concerning firearm and toolmark identification or source attribution is unreliable and should be ruled inadmissible. However, this critique does not stem from the hard work of actually obtaining data and performing the scientific research required to support or reject current findings in the literature. Although there are sound reasons (described herein) why there is currently no unifying probabilistic model for the comparison of striated and impressed toolmarks as there is in the field of forensic DNA profiling, much statistical research has been, and continues to be, done to aid the criminal justice system. This research has thus far shown that error rate estimates for the field are very low, especially when compared to other forms of judicial error. The first purpose of this paper is to point out the logical fallacies in the arguments of a small group of pundits, who advocate a particular viewpoint but cloak it as fact and research. The second purpose is to give a balanced review of the literature regarding random match probability models and statistical applications that have been carried out in forensic firearm and toolmark analysis.},

The standard bullets are developed as a reference standard for bullet signature measurements and are aimed to support the recently established National Integrated Ballistics Information Network (NIBIN) by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The RM bullets are designed as both a virtual and a physical bullet signature standard. The virtual standard is a set of six digitized bullet signatures originally profiled from six master bullets fired at ATF and FBI using six different guns. By using the virtual signature standard to control the tool path on a numerically controlled diamond turning machine at NIST, 40 RM bullets were produced. In this paper, a comparison parameter and an algorithm using autoand cross-correlation functions are described for qualifying the bullet signature differences between the RM bullets and the virtual bullet signature standard. When two compared signatures are exactly the same (point by point), their cross-correlation function (CCF) value will be equal to 100\%. The measurement system setup, measurement program, and initial measurement results are discussed. Initial measurement results for the 40 standard bullets, each measured at six land impressions, show that the CCF values for the 240 signature measurements are higher than 95\%, with most of them even higher than 99\%. These results demonstrate the high reproducibility for both the manufacturing process and the measurement system for the NIST RM 8240 standard bullets.},

This paper describes the recently developed congruent matching cells (CMC) method for image comparisons, its application to ﬁrearm evidence identiﬁcation, and its usage and initial tests for error rate estimation. The CMC method divides compared topography images into correlation cells. Four identiﬁcation parameters are deﬁned for quantifying both the topography similarity of the correlated cell pairs and the pattern congruency of the registered cell locations. A declared match requires a signiﬁcant number of CMCs, i.e., cell pairs that meet all similarity and congruency requirements. Initial testing on breech face impressions of a set of 40 cartridge cases ﬁred with consecutively manufactured pistol slides showed wide separation between the distributions of CMC numbers observed for known matching and known non-matching image pairs. Another test on 95 cartridge cases from a different set of slides manufactured by the same process also yielded widely separated distributions. The test results were used to develop two statistical models for the probability mass function of CMC correlation scores. The models were applied to develop a framework for estimating cumulative false positive and false negative error rates and individual error rates of declared matches and non-matches for this population of breech face impressions. The prospect for applying the models to large populations and realistic case work is also discussed. The CMC method can provide a statistical foundation for estimating error rates in ﬁrearm evidence identiﬁcations, thus emulating methods used for forensic identiﬁcation of DNA evidence.},

The applications have included (1) the manufacture of standard reference material (SRM) bullets and casings, (2) methods to assess whether bullets or casings have been fired by the same firearm, and (3) research to quantify similarities or differences between profiles of the same surface measured by different techniques or between a master surface and its replicas. The cross-correlation maximum is the functional parameter used to quantify similarity. A second parameter, called the relative profile (2D) difference or relative areal topography (3D) difference, may also be used to quantify differences and to recognize the ambiguous condition when two results have different vertical (z-) scales but identical shapes. Most of these examples have been applied in support of ballistics inspection methods in crime labs, but the methods are generally useful for estimating the accuracy of surface replication techniques or the ability of different surface topography instruments to measure the same surface and provide the same result. The instruments used in these studies were a stylus instrument and a Nipkow-disk type confocal microscope. Cross-correlation functions may also be used to assess differences resulting from the use of different filters to modify the same surface profile or topography image.},

  abstract = {The identification of firearms from forensic ballistics specimens is an exacting and intensive activity performed by specialists with extensive experience. The introduction of imaging technology to assist the identification process of firearms has enhanced the ability of forensic ballisticians to conduct analyses of these specimens for identification. The characteristic markings on the cartridge and projectile of a bullet fired from a gun can be recognised as a fingerprint for identification of the firearm. Forensic ballistics imaging has the capacity to produce high-resolution digital images of cartridge cases and projectiles for matching of crime scene specimens to test specimens. Projectile bullets fired through the barrel of a gun will exhibit extremely fine striation markings, some of which are derived from minute irregularities in the barrel produced during the manufacturing process. The examination of these striations on the land marks and groove marks of the projectile is difficult using conventional optical microscopy. However, digital imaging techniques have the potential to detect the presence of striations on ballistics specimens for identification matching. This paper describes a linescan imaging technique to examine the striation markings on the land marks and groove marks of projectiles for positive identification. The paper discusses the application of the technique to cylindrical forensic ballistics specimens, and the potential of the technique for image matching. Digital images of land marks and groove marks of projectiles produced by the line scan technique are presented, and analyses of the images are conducted.},

Automatic comparison algorithms have been introduced for various scenarios, such as matching cartridge cases [1], [2] or matching bullet striae [3], [4], [5]. One key aspect of validating these automatic comparison algorithms is to evaluate the performance of the algorithm on external tests, that is, using data which were not used to train the algorithm. Here, we present a discussion of the performance of the matching algorithm [6] in three studies conducted using different Ruger weapons. We consider the performance of three scoring measures: random forest score, cross correlation, and consecutive matching striae (CMS) at the land-to-land level and, using Sequential Average Maxima scores, also at the bullet-to bullet level. Cross correlation and random forest scores both result in perfect discrimination of same-source and different-source bullets. At the land-to-land level, discrimination for both cross correlation and random forest scores (based on area under the curve, AUC) is excellent (≥ 0.90).},

  abstract = {The characteristic markings on the cartridge and projectile of a bullet fired from a gun can be recognised as a "fingerprint" for identification of the firearm. Over thirty different features within these markings can be distinguished, which in combination produce a "fingerprint" for identification of a firearm. The analysis of marks on cartridge casings and projectiles that have been fired, provides a precise tool for identifying the class of firearm from which a bullet was discharged. The measurement of features on ballistics cartridge cases and projectiles allow precise ballistics metrics to be obtained of cartridge case and projectile class characteristics for the identification of the make and model of the firearm. These different features within these markings and patterns can be identified, which in combination produce a "fingerprint" for any type of firearm. A variety of features can be observed under moderate or high magnification of the specimen. However, not all features are observable for all weapons under all conditions of discharge. This situation represents the classical situation of "missing data" when attempting to demonstrate "similarity" between specimens. This condition is overcome by seeking "feature by feature" comparisons without achieving identical matching for the crime scene and test specimens. This paper will describe progress in the development of a multi-dimensional cluster analysis model for forensic ballistics specimens to identify the type of weapon that produced these ballistics specimens. The cluster analysis will provide classification that is based on scalar shape and measurement parameters for the three-dimensional features of class characteristics. These class characteristics include calibre, firing pin mark, ejector mark, and extractor mark for the cartridge case; and number and widths of land and groove marks, and the direction of twist of rifling on the projectiles. The selection of appropriate class characteristics for cartridge and projectile can be mapped in N-dimensional space to provide clustering for particular weapon types. By mapping the crime scene specimen to the multidimensional ballistics data, the possibility of a match for identification may be achieved. This project has the potential to significantly improve the effectiveness and efficiency of tracing of firearms used in criminal activities.},

More recently focus has turned to making use of more sophisticated imaging modalities to view entire regions of the projectile and the development of automated systems for the comparison of the topographical surfaces recorded. Projectiles from a newly bought air pistol with 0.177 calibre pellets (unjacketed), fired series of 609 pellets were examined using an optical microscope. A mathematical methodology was developed to preprocess the resultant topographical maps generating point data for comparison, analysed using the principal component analysis (PCA). In most cases limited to reasonable success was achieved. The objective method still requires an operator to identify the Land Engraved Areas to be scanned, however the mathematical alignments were objectively achieved. The PCA results illustrated that the striation marks were neither exclusive nor specific to the LEA regions but rather crossed over regions. This study also proves that a single weapon does not necessarily leave identical marks of projectiles on its surface.},

Although some modifications are undertaken to simply acquire a functioning firearm, others are perpetrated as a direct forensic countermeasure to prevent the association between a firearm and a crime. This article describes the effects of these modifications on bullet striation patterns imparted from the barrel to a fired bullet. The key results indicated that the investigated modifications display assessable characteristics. The use of an oversized barrel imparted striations consistent with firing with the absence of typical rifling. Subsequent or consecutively fired bullets possessed striation variations, with the first showing the least evidence of striations. The application of a choke resulted in more obvious bullet elongation compared to a smoothbore barrel. The restriction caused merging of lands and groves of the imparted rifling and obscured their usual definition. Effects of breech adaption were also characterised by observing the buckling and enlargement of the cartridge case. This deformity of the cartridge case was most evident when the barrel pressure increased due to the presence of the choke. From this study it was evident that unique characteristic impressions associated with different modifications most commonly found in criminal investigations can be utilised by a forensic expert and impart significant intelligence to an investigation.},

In the experiment, striation densities for six lands of 48 bullets fired from 12 gun barrels of six manufactures are calculated. Statistical results show strong relation between striation density and identification rate.

The 3D topographies are divided into arrays of correlation cells to identify ???valid correlation areas??? and eliminate ???invalid correlation areas??? from the matching and identification procedure. A ???congruent matching cells??? (CMC)??? method using three types of identification parameters of the paired correlation cells (cross correlation function maximum CCF max , spatial registration position in x ??? y and registration angle ??) is used for high accuracy ballistics identifications. ???Synchronous processing??? is proposed for correlating multiple cell pairs at the same time to increase the correlation speed. The proposed NBIS can be used for correlations of both geometrical topographies and optical intensity images. All the correlation parameters and algorithms are in the public domain and subject to open tests. An error rate reporting procedure has been developed that can greatly add to the scientific support for the firearm and toolmark identification specialty, and give confidence to the trier of fact in court proceedings. The NBIS is engineered to employ transparent identification parameters and criteria, statistical models and correlation algorithms. In this way, interoperability between different ballistics identification systems can be more easily achieved. This interoperability will make the NBIS suitable for ballistics identifications and evidence searches with large national databases, such as the National Integrated Ballistic Information Network in the United States.},

	abstract = {Ballistic imaging databases allow law enforcement to link recovered cartridge cases to other crime scenes and to firearms. The success of these databases has led many to propose that all firearms in circulation be entered into a reference ballistic image database (RBID). To assess the performance of an RBID, we fired 4200 cartridge cases from 600 9mm Para Sig Sauer model P226 series pistols. Each pistol fired two Remington cartridges, one of which was imaged in the RBID, and five additional cartridges, consisting of Federal, Speer, Winchester, Wolf, and CCI brands. Randomly selected samples from the second series of Remington cartridge cases and from the five additional brands were then correlated against the RBID. Of the 32 cartridges of the same make correlated against the RBID, 72\% ranked in the top 10 positions. Likewise, of the 160 cartridges of the five different brands correlated against the database, 21\% ranked in the top 10 positions. Generally, the ranking position increased as the size of the RBID increased. We obtained similar results when we expanded the RBID to include firearms with the same class characteristics for breech face marks, firing pin impressions, and extractor marks. The results of our six queries against the RBID indicate that a reference ballistics image database of new guns is currently fraught with too many difficulties to be an effective and efficient law enforcement tool.},

This article aims to provide a critical review of the key scientific principles and practices specifically involved with forensic firearm identification and to discuss how misidentifications have resulted in cases of injustice. Implementation of quality assured examination practice, demonstration of individual examiner competence and more objective methods of reporting are being adopted by firearm examiners and laboratories to address some of the criticisms relating to subjectivity and standardisation inherent within the discipline. The impact of these changes is outlined and further recommendations are made for both examiners and legal professionals to minimise the potential for future injustices involving firearms evidence. Latest research in the field is cited, continuing to support the theory and use of firearm identification as admissible evidence in court.},

	abstract = {The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is a two-dimensional measure of classification performance. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is a scalar measure gauging one facet of performance. In this short article, five idealized models are utilized to relate the shape of the ROC curve, and the area under it, to features of the underlying distribution of forecasts. This allows for an interpretation of the former in terms of the latter. The analysis is pedagogical in that many of the findings are already known in more general (and more realistic) settings; however, the simplicity of the models considered here allows for a clear exposition of the relation. For example, although in general there are many reasons for an asymmetric ROC curve, the models considered here clearly illustrate that an asymmetry in the ROC curve can be attributed to unequal widths of the distributions. Furthermore, it is shown that AUC discriminates well between ???good??? and ???bad??? models, but not between good models.},
