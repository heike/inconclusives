\begin{itemize}
\item Full pipeline errors
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \svp{\citet{edmondGuideInterpretingForensic2014} is a fingerprint study that discusses the potential for errors at any stage in the process and the limitations of error rate studies as they are currently performed.}
    \item \svp{\citet{hozoDecisionMakingWhenData2008} calls for what seems to be full pipeline analysis of errors, with included components tailored to the goals of the research. Focused primarily on clinical trials, so a good portion of the paper doesn't apply...}
  \end{itemize}
  
\item \svp{It may be worth comparing/contrasting AFTE guidelines to SWGTREAD and other disciplines (SWGTREAD has a few extra categories that make it interesting \citep{swgtread-conclusions-2013}) and Uniform Language Testimony and Reporting guidelines - e.g. \citet{ULTR-latent} and \citet{ULTR-firearms-pattern} (all of the ULTR guidelines are at \url{https://www.justice.gov/olp/uniform-language-testimony-and-reports}).}
\item \svp{Inconclusives also show up in diagnostic medicine (x-rays, mammograms, scans). Is the statistical treatment there any different given that typically there are better defined populations and some available statistical information on those populations? It's also worth noting that you can recall the patient and do additional (informative) testing with people; with forensic evidence, you can't get better data than what you had initially. }

\item \svp{From my read of \citet{tukeyConclusionsVsDecisions}, it seems to be an argument for inconclusives (e.g. doing nothing). It may be worth differentiating the error rate calculation focused on the examiner's decision from action taken by the legal system, which is a full-pipeline thing that includes systematic errors during evidence recording, collection, etc. (things the examiner doesn't control). What defendents care about is the full-scope conclusion, which includes consideration of all of the errors earlier in the pipeline. }
